NOTE ΟΝ THE Usu OF THE BOOK .

The Simplified Text and the Exercises based upon it are oi tha
first importance. The oisc voce translation oi the Exercises, followed
by the wrlting oi them, will illustrate and help to implant in the
memory the most important principles of syntax met with in the text.
Let the toacher insist upon thorough work here, and he may safely
omit other syntactical instruction.

But little power of reading Latin can be gained without ,making
the acquisition oi a working vocabulary a distinct object. The Latin

synonyma and the Etymological vocabulary may be made useful .

agents to that end. If the words added to each chapter are read
aloud, r‘eviewed, and compared where backward references are made,
the learner will acquire a useful stock of synonyms easily, naturally,
and with small expenditure of time.-

Itis often easler to retain in mind a number of words, grouped
according to some principle of similarity or contrast, than a single
word with nothing tc hook it to the memory. For this reason itis
recommended that the Etymological Vocabulary be often pressed into

the service. suppose, for example, the word conspectus occurs in the'
lesson. If the teachcr will turn to page 138 and have the ten words
read out under the root SPEC, he will multiply several times the
chauces that this particular word will be remembered on its next .

occurrence. He will have done much more. He will have increased
the chauces that nine other words will be lodged in the memory3 and
to each one a fresh interest will be added by its being seen in relation,
not as an isclated‚ and therefore barren, fact.

The first vocabulary may be used for comparing in the text the
different meanings and uses of the same word. Itis through such
comparisons that one gete at the heart and spirit of the language,
while cultivating at the same time a mental habit of great value.

Having read the Simplified Text, the learner should be well equipped
for wrestling with the difficulties that remain in the unchanged text,
for he is already familiar with the thought and the language. Com-
parison of the two texts by the toacher, so far as time permits, may
now be made to illustrate important principles, as of indirect discourse,
which are here and there discussed in the notes.
