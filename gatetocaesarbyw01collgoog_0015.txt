' to supply a form plainly understood, or to introduce some
eonnective, like et, tum, itaque, aetem, erpo, postremo.

Aeto the amount of excision, Ι find that Ι have omitted
almost exactly one-fifth of Gaesar's text.

If the beginner in Oaesar reads the simplified text and
concurrently turns the Exercises into Latin, laying firm
hold of the grammatical principles selected for illustration,
Ι believe he will find the remaining difficulties oi the origi·
nal text not beyond his scope. 1 should even hope that
he would then read with something of the joy of consciens
power. If the reading of the texts and the writing of the
Exercises should require more time than is usually spent
on the' second book of Oaesar, which, however, I doubt, I
believe subsequent progress would still be rapid and satis·
factory enough to amount to anet gain and saving of time.

It has seemed best to mark long vowels, except the
vowels of final syllables and of monosyllableS, the rules for
which can he readily learned. I have, however, marked a
few monosyllables, as a constant reminder to toachers who
find their old pronunciation clinging to certain words. We ·
used to say his, sic, ndo, quia, hdo. These words, therefore,
Ihave marked. On the other hand, one is in no danger ol
saying di, bi, si, pud, for old habit would not mislead.

Ι take pleasure in acknowledging my obligations to Mr.
Alfred G. Rolfe for several useful criticismS, and to Miss
Caroline Ober Stone for valnable corrections and for care
fully reading the prees-sheets as far as the vocabularies.
To Mr. Clarence W. Gleason I am specially indebted. But
for his timely and genereus aid in preparing both vocabu·
laries, thepublication of this book must have been very

considerably delayed.
