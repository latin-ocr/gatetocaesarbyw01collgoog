Oaesar is adifficult author. Some parts of his Gallio War
are as hard, or nearly as hard, as any prose Latin that has ,
come down to us. Yet it has somehow strangely enough .
become the iashion to read that work first in a Latin course.
My own conviction is that for young learners a year²s read·
ing in easier Latin is not too much before taking up the
less difficolt books of the Gallic War. Even then the
transition to Caesar comes with something of a shock3 for
the learner is soon and often brought face to face with
sentences that seem to him of most bewildering intricacy,
however they may, as commentators sometimes remark,
beautifully illustrate most important principles of Latin
¹ order and construction There is a sentence in the second
book, by no means the most difficult one to be found, that
extends through eighteen linos—that is, something more
than half a page—containing twentyone distinct ideas,
and having the verb separated from its subject by ninety· ,

· four words.

I know no more disheartening task than that of under·
taking to carry a class unprepared in age and knowledge
of the language through Oeesads Gallie War. Yet it is pre·
cisely this disheartening task that thousands of teachers are
set to do, or set themselves to dc, every year. The results

s are often dismal enough. Teachers are blamed, they blame

themselves, they blame their pupils. Pupils may sometimes
be stupid, teachers may lack knowledge of the language
and the subject, but the fault may also lie wholly with the
author or with the Latin language itself 3 if with the latter,
there is no help. Latin, it must be confessed, is an exoeed·
ingly difficult language to learn. All the more reason then
why, in attacking it, every uunecessary obstacle should be
removed We should make our approaohes with cantion
