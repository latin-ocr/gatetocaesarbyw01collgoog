and skill3 we should take it, 11 possible, oporto latere. We
should not begin with a diffioult work3 or 11, in the dearth

Oaesar knew how to write his own language well, but he
⁵ wrote 161 men, 116 wrote with compression and in haste, and
there are passages in his works that are tough reading for a
good Latin soholar. It 16 the fashion to praise Oaesar's lu·
oidity; but brevity and haste are not eonduoive to lueidity.

“Ther nys no werkman, what so everha be,
’11111 may bothe werke wel, and hastily.
This wol be doon 61 leyser parfitly.”

For my part Ι confess that Ι sometimes find him obseure.
Moreover, when I am in doubt 66 to his meaning and appeal
to the commentatore, I find that they generally disagree and
sometimes quarrel about the sense. Therefore to put young
learners to reading Caesar 16 his text stands, bristling with
difficulties, before they have aequired anything more than 1
meagre voeabulary and gained a modicum of insight by some
practice in reading easier Latin, is to 661 them at 1 task
harder than that whieh Pharaoh set the 1611611166.

Iam 61 the opinion that, even when a 1111 working voeabu-
lary 1116 been aequired through some previous reading, there
is no book 61 the Gallio War 11111 does 1161 require 1 certain
degree 61 simplification to bring it to the level 61 the powers
of young boys and girls. Ii is this eonviotion born 61 long
observation 61 the vexation 61 spirit, discouragement, and
waste 61 time by pupils in wrestling with difficulties that

1 Itis presumed that the learner will subsequently read the completa text.
