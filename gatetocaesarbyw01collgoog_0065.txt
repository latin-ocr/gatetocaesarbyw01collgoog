lussonucrosr Nora-To translato Latin into English is to express
the meaningof theLatininEnglish wordsand inthe English idiom. Butthe
meaning must be discovered before it can be expressed. Discovering the
sense is, therefore, a process preparatory to translation, but yet measurably
distinct from it. For discovering the meaning, the golden rule is, Toke
worda and clauses in the order in which they stand: lf the first chapter
of this book were rendered into English words exactly in the Latin order,
the thought would be readily apprehended by any one quite unacquainted
with Latin. Such a word for word rendering, mental or oral, is for the
beginner a necessary preliminary to translation, but, 1 repeat, must not be
confounded with translation. For that, the golden rule is, Express the
thought in pure English, without admittere os Latin idiom.
