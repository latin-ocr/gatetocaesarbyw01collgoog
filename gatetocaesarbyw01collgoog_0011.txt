PREFAOE.

-οοο-

Tan recent discovery of a work of Aristotle has inter·
ested and delighted the whole learned world; but one may
venture to say that if, instead, a book had been found
Δ written in the best period oi the Latin language for the ’
amusement or instruction oi youth, by some Roman De
Foe, or Goldsmith, or Lamb, or Bumett, there would beten
times the reason lor rejoieing. Unhappily there is no
likelihood that we shall ever congratulate ourselves on
suoh a “find'' for probably no such work ever existed.
What a misfortune that it did not oeour to Cicero to divert
himself in some leisure'hour by writing a story for Roman
youth! Millions of boys and girls in these later ages would
have had good reason to bless his name. Caesar eould have
done it; but to him, too, the gods denied such an inspiration,
and we must suffer for it. Seeing that he had composed a
treatise on Latin Grammar, one almost wonders that amiud

so original and fertile should not have conceived the idea ’

of adapting his Gallie War, or some part of it, to the
powers and comprehension of youth. What measureless
gratitude would he not have won from unhorn generations
of sehoolmasters, who have now to struggle desperately and
often unavailingly to make clear to their pupils the meaning
of his intricate periods, and untwist the stranda of his

knotty syntaxi
